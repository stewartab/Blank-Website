# Website-Project

We've finally finished the main 'index.html' web. But still, we'll figure things out as i'll finish coding some our the buttons on the web. Thanks for the internet for the resources I can find. Maybe next time, we'll use JavaScript to assign some functions in a perfect way. Less hassle for managing a web script.

Updates:
